### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm George, a seasoned full-stack developer with 5 years of hands-on experience in web development. My focus is on creating captivating user experiences through intuitive interfaces. I've worked extensively with various frameworks, including Angular, Vue.js, React, and more recenelty Svelte/SvelteKit, which has become a favorite for its elegance and the speed it brings to my projects.

Alongside my frontend mastery, I'm well-versed in backend technologies, Node.js being my primary tool. Furthermore, I have experience with AWS and serverless architectures, ensuring that my solutions are both efficient and effective.

Beyond coding, I find joy in gaming, strumming my guitar, learning new tools and technologies delving into low-level languages like Rust and C++ as well as game development.

Excited to collaborate and turn your digital visions into reality!
